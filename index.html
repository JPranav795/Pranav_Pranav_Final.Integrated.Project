                        <h3>The History of Nuts in Beverages</h3>
                        <p>Nuts have been part of human diets for millennia, but using them in drinks? That’s a Dr. NUT innovation. Let’s take a deep dive into the history of nuts, starting with ancient civilizations. The Egyptians used almonds in their rituals, the Greeks roasted hazelnuts for feasts, and the Romans crushed walnuts into wine. Fast forward to the Middle Ages, and nut milks became a staple in Europe. By the 19th century, peanuts were a global sensation, thanks to the rise of peanut butter. But no one thought to carbonate them—until us!</p>
                        <p>Our journey began in 2025, when our founder, Dr. Nuttingham, had a wild idea: what if we could make a fizzy nut drink? He spent years researching, traveling to nut farms, and experimenting in his garage. The result was Dr. NUT, a drink that combines history, science, and a whole lot of fun. Want more details? We’ve got 20 more paragraphs of nut history below—keep scrolling!</p>
